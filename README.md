🧬 Scientific Framework: MOVE™ Pillars

From the validated clinical protocol:

M — Mobilize Early
Pain-free AROM, breath-led mobility, graded tissue glides.

O — Optimize Load
Isometric → isotonic → eccentric progression with structured RPE.

V — Validate Neural Control
Proprioception, balance, perturbation tasks, hop-prep.

E — Energize Recovery
Zone-2/3 cardio for systemic circulation and metabolic support.

Fully aligned to the mechanotherapy principles (Khan & Scott, BJSM 2009) and PEACE & LOVE guidelines (Dubois & Esculier, BJSM 2020).
